                        Hello, everyone! I'm Noah Fryman, I grew up in Galloway, Ohio all the way until I turned 19 and
                        moved into my own apartment with my girlfriend. All the way from age 5 to 18 I grew up playing
                        travel soccer. I traveled everywhere from Missouri, Florida, Illinois and much more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I spent two years of my life in the construction industry, installing counter-tops. During this
                        time I didn't exacly have a plan except that I didn't want to do this for the rest of my life.
                        From the time that I was off work to the time I went to bed I would always be working on
                        something from the side. It started from creating my own ecommerce brand to learn trading the
                        stock market and forex. To where I'm currently at now learning web development. The main
                        takeaway that I've learned throughout all of these processes is that when I find something that
                        I'm passionate about, I fall in love with the process of learning everything that I can about
                        it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I've always been fascinated with why and how things work. More specifically, why and how certain
                        things work on our computers. This fascination has always led me to want to learn about the
                        programming of websites and applications. When I was in highschool I was accepted and was going
                        to go to our career center to learn computer engineering, but I didn't end up doing that. Then,
                        for college I was accepted to go to University of Cincinnati for computer engineering but,
                        didn't end up going.
